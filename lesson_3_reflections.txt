Q: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keep all you work locally?

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

   clone is making a duplication from a specified branch in a repository (locally or on GitHub) to an newly created branch in another local repository.
   branche is a named sequence of commits.
